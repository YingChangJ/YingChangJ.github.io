Chart Reverse Search Engineering; Julian Day Number Calculator; Bazi Reverse Search
A simple webpage host for these useful tools. Simple method I am using @see https://github.com/YingChangJ/YingChangJ.github.io/blob/main/javascript/readme.md
All calculations using Astronomy Engine (another version uses Swiss Ephemeris, which is easier for chart-related calculation and a tiny little more accurate, but need a server... then I turned to Astronomy Engine)
